# Donkey-Kong

This project consists in the designing of the Donkey Kong video game by implementing Object Oriented Programming. Our goal was to emulate the original game and achieve a good classes’ design in order to do so.
The game features Mario’s basic movements (going left, right, climbing and descending ladders and jumping over barrels) and score, and the barrels’ movement over the platforms as well as their descending by ladders with a chance of 25%.

There are six different classes:
1. players
2. barras: static
3. barril
4. kong: static
5. princess :static
6. stairs: static

## Players
It has different methods, such as, newmove() or run()

## Barril
It has 5 different attributes: the barrels’ X position, Y position, direction and the image we use for the barrels to not be static
